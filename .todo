  ☐ Use browser APIs to offer "Add to home screen" functionality for mobile users -> search for "PWA" (Progressive Web App) and implement it. (https://web.dev/add-to-homescreen/)
    ☐ test on mobile

  ✔ send only required information to the frontend (remove unnecessary data from the response) @done(25-05-05 22:19)
  ☐ comment code, remove unused code and files, and make sure everything is working as expected
  


Deployment:
  ☐ dockerize the app (docker-compose) and make sure everything is working as expected
  ☐ get a vps and configure from scratch (caddy, nginx, etc.) and make sure everything is working as expected - maybe get vps from https://www.hetzner.com/
  ☐ get a domain and configure it to point to the vps and make sure everything is working as expected
  ☐ add a readme file to the repo with instructions on how to run the app locally and how to deploy it
  ☐ add a license file to the repo (maybe MIT or something like that)
  ☐ add a .env file to the repo with instructions on how to create it and what to put in it
  ☐ create a github actions file to automate the deployment process (build and push the docker image to docker hub, and deploy it to the vps)
  ☐ add a way to track the app usage (maybe using google analytics or something like that)
  

☐ when finalized, create reddit posts to show off the app

Backlog - to implement:
  ☐ post content in markdown 
  ☐ add locale to settings
  ☐ export to csv file
  ☐ performance improvements (maybe related to images)
  ☐ highlight the seached text on the posts (and show how many posts matched) 
  ☐ even tho i have all posts loaded, only load some of them (20) and then load more when scrolling down (infinite scroll)
  ☐ Saved posts will now be cached locally in the browser so the search would be available right after loading while posts are refreshed from Reddit.


  1. Implement Virtual Scrolling (Windowing)
The most effective solution would be to implement virtual scrolling (windowing), which only renders the items currently visible in the viewport.

Backlog - (features to consider for future updates):
  ☐ Dashboard and Stats (Create a dashboard showing statistics about saved posts, Track saving patterns, favorite subreddits, etc.)
  ☐ Add text customization (font size, line spacing)
  ☐ Improve caching of API responses for faster loading and reduced API usage
  ☐ Pin posts (Allow users to pin certain posts to the top of their saved list for easy access)


Bug Fixes and Improvements:
  ☐ Video sound not working. not really important, but would be nice to have
  ☐ add "no saved posts" message when there are no saved posts
