  ☐ better scatfolding for the proxy server

    ☐ add better error handling
    ☐ add .env file for the proxy server
    ☐ add a .env.example file for the proxy server

  ✔ send only required information to the frontend (remove unnecessary data from the response) @done(25-05-05 22:19)
  ☐ comment code, remove unused code and files, and make sure everything is working as expected
  ☐ algo está errado com os url - talvez por causa dos thumbnails
  


Deployment:
  ☐ dockerize the app (docker-compose) and make sure everything is working as expected
  ☐ get a vps and configure from scratch (caddy, nginx, etc.) and make sure everything is working as expected - maybe get vps from https://www.hetzner.com/
  ☐ get a domain and configure it to point to the vps and make sure everything is working as expected
  ☐ add a readme file to the repo with instructions on how to run the app locally and how to deploy it
  ☐ add a license file to the repo (maybe MIT or something like that)
  ☐ add a .env file to the repo with instructions on how to create it and what to put in it
  ☐ create a github actions file to automate the deployment process (build and push the docker image to docker hub, and deploy it to the vps)
  ☐ add a way to track the app usage (maybe using google analytics or something like that)
  

☐ when finalized, create reddit posts to show off the app

Backlog - to implement:
  ☐ post content in markdown 
  ☐ add locale to settings
  ☐ export to csv file
  ☐ performance improvements (maybe related to images)
  ☐ highlight the seached text on the posts (and show how many posts matched) 
  ☐ even tho i have all posts loaded, only load some of them (20) and then load more when scrolling down (infinite scroll)
  ☐ Saved posts will now be cached locally in the browser so the search would be available right after loading while posts are refreshed from Reddit.


  1. Implement Virtual Scrolling (Windowing)
The most effective solution would be to implement virtual scrolling (windowing), which only renders the items currently visible in the viewport.


Virtualization (Windowing):

Use a library like react-window or react-virtualized to only render the visible posts in the viewport. This drastically reduces the number of DOM nodes and improves performance.
Lazy Loading Images:

Use the loading="lazy" attribute on images or a library like react-lazyload to defer loading images until they are about to enter the viewport.
Debounce Search and Resize:

Debounce the search input and grid resize calculations to avoid excessive re-renders and recalculations.
Optimize Grid Calculations:

Consider using CSS-only masonry layouts (e.g., grid-template-rows: masonry) if browser support is sufficient, or switch to a simpler layout for large lists.
Pagination or Infinite Scroll:

Instead of showing all posts, implement pagination or infinite scrolling to load posts in chunks.

Backlog - (features to consider for future updates):
  ☐ Dashboard and Stats (Create a dashboard showing statistics about saved posts, Track saving patterns, favorite subreddits, etc.)
  ☐ Add text customization (font size, line spacing)
  ☐ Improve caching of API responses for faster loading and reduced API usage
  ☐ Pin posts (Allow users to pin certain posts to the top of their saved list for easy access)
  ☐ Remove all PWA logic and files (service worker, manifest, install prompt, icons, etc.)


Bug Fixes and Improvements:
  ☐ Video sound not working. not really important, but would be nice to have
  ☐ add "no saved posts" message when there are no saved posts



✅ When Docker Swarm is useful
Use Docker Swarm if you:

Plan to scale your app across multiple VPS nodes (i.e., clustering).

Want built-in service discovery, load balancing, and failover.

Need zero-downtime rolling updates for services.

Prefer a simpler alternative to Kubernetes for orchestrating containers.

❌ When Docker Swarm isn't necessary
Skip Docker Swarm if you:

Are deploying to a single VPS with no immediate plans to scale out.

Just want to run your MERN app in containers for convenience and consistency.

Are fine managing containers with docker-compose or plain docker run.

🛠 Recommended approach for single VPS:
Use Docker Compose for local development and production deployment.

Include services like:

client (React)

server (Node.js/Express)

mongo

Optional: Nginx or Caddy for reverse proxy and SSL

Set up a CI/CD pipeline to redeploy on code changes.
