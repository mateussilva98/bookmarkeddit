reeven feeback:
  line between categories,
  search is filter but not in filters and not reset when  clear filters is clicked (it literally says filter by title) xdd,
  space between profile and settings icon and logout is not equal,
  clear filters and hide filters feel weirdly positioned,
  hide filters is unintuitive at least description wise, would never have imagined it closed the sidebar thingy,
  something to try out is making a blocky appearance around the layout thingy, so the spacing doesnt feel different there (aka same kinda markup as for the select and search next to it) might feel more in line with the rest too,
  sometimes there is a line between items but most of the time there is not, why?,
  spacong top and bottom refresh button is not equal (also not equal with slightly more down the other line),
  you have the name of the author, might be nice if you could go to their profile directly, same with subreddit,
  the go to button could technically be the whole box with all its content like on reddit itself ig,
  logo feels slightly too large, or not enough space around it, think I'd try to make it a tad smaller,
  accessibility wise the select state of the only nsfw posts is not great, particularly the post count, hard to read in darkmode,
  4 saved posts is not aligned with the filters below it, aligjtly more inward, also refresh icon compared to accordion dings,
  in lightmode the icon of layput display is harsubreddit, make it more obvious you can click on it, hover styles,
  not sure why, but when i tried ta bbing through everything, i wasnt able to go into the accordions,
  some buttons and links are missing focus styles,
  when tabbing through the app, i get trapped on the open the post link, not immediately sure why,
  lightmode post text is not readable enough,
  consider adding a skiplink,
  the go to profile is not a tab-able element, so hidden for screen readers too (maybe)?
  bunch of buttons without text (see axe core), can make it only visible to screen readers and such, if you're using tailwind (add the "sr-only" class)),
  saved post in dark mode is not readable enough in theory,
  bunch of links with no text (again sr only),
  select needs a label, can be sronly (maybe),
  lots more contrast issues in lightmode (see axe core),
  in lightmode the orange could be slightly less bright as a focus style, cus might give of terror vibes, which is not what we want, altho if you use reddit, should be smart enough to understand the color schema, so that might be a pebcak,
  Uhmn, one last thing, your name in lightmode is not readable enough on your logout homepage, should be readable cus its something to be proud of




Backlog - to implement:
  ☐ post content in markdown 
  ☐ add locale to settings
  ☐ export to csv file
  ☐ performance improvements (maybe related to images?)
    ☐ Option 1: Implement Virtual Scrolling (Windowing) - The most effective solution would be to implement virtual scrolling (windowing), which only renders the items currently visible in the viewport.
    ☐ Option 2: Debounce Search and Resize: - Debounce the search input and grid resize calculations to avoid excessive re-renders and recalculations. (can i calculate based on image properties and associate them with the posts?)
    ☐ Option 3: Optimize Grid Calculations - Consider using CSS-only masonry layouts (e.g., grid-template-rows: masonry) if browser support is sufficient, or switch to a simpler layout for large lists.
    ☐ Option 4: Pagination or Infinite Scroll - Instead of showing all posts, implement pagination or infinite scrolling to load posts in chunks. (Infinite scroll is already implemented, but maybe not in the best way)
    ☐ Option 5: Load low quality images first - Load low-quality images. Since it's just a preview, you can load lower-quality images first and then replace them with higher-quality ones once they are loaded. This can be done using the `srcset` attribute or by using a library like `react-lazyload` or `react-lazyload-image-component`. It can be a new setting
  ☐ highlight the seached text on the posts (and show how many posts matched) 
  ☐ replace implemented logic with a library like Winston, Pino, Morgan, Buyan or log4js that sabes the logs to a file and/or sends them to a remote server for analysis.
  




Backlog - (features to consider for future updates):
  ☐ Dashboard and Stats (Create a dashboard showing statistics about saved posts, Track saving patterns, favorite subreddits, etc.)
  ☐ Add text customization (font size, line spacing)
  ☐ Pin posts (Allow users to pin certain posts to the top of their saved list for easy access)
  ☐ PWA (service worker, manifest, install prompt, icons, etc.)


Bug Fixes and Improvements:
  ☐ Video sound not working. not really important, but would be nice to have
